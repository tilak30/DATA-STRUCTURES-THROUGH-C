# DATA-STRUCTURES-THROUGH-C
     Implementation of all the data structures like stack, queue, linked list, etc.


## 1. Stack using static arrays     
Implementation of stack using static array in c - Full program. Basically tells you how we implement stack in c. As in c++ these are given as data types so we don't know how it works in real. This gives us a good example of how is last in first out works in stacks. Run this code and see it yourself how stacks work. 
     
## 2. Linked List
Implementation of single linked list in c It contain code for implementation of single linked list in c using dynamic programming. There are several functions to show operations for ex- append, delete, find length, etc. Please go through for better understanding of single linked list data structure.

## 3. Stack using linked list
Stack implementation using singly linked list For seeing how it works run this code. It contains operations like push, pop, etc.

## 4. Queue
Basic queue data structure implementation Queue data structure implementation is basically a queue with first in, first out rule. Run this code to understand queue better. As it is written in c, s it is most basic form as in c++ and other languages you will see them as data structure where u need not write anything at all. 
     
## 5. Doubly linked list
Doubly linked list implementation will give u a great view on how it iterates. This is very common data structure. It will help u get ground zero knowledge of this data structure.
